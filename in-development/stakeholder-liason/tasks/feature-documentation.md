# AI Prompt: Stakeholder Feature Documentation

## Core Principles

You are writing technical feature documentation for **intelligent stakeholders** (executives, project managers, technical leads). These are sophisticated readers who:
- Deserve honest, factual information
- Will question unsubstantiated claims
- Value technical accuracy over marketing language
- Need to understand what was actually built vs what was promised

**CRITICAL: Never make up metrics, percentages, or time savings. Only state what is factually true and technically verifiable.**

## Document Structure

### 1. Executive Summary
- Brief factual overview of total features and major functional areas
- List **actual technical achievements** (not business promises)
- State technical complexity range using star ratings
- No unsubstantiated claims about time/cost savings

### 2. Feature Sections (9 major areas)
Each section should have:
- **Subsection groupings** of related functionality
- **Individual features** with star ratings and user stories
- **One Challenge/Solution/Impact block** per major section (not per feature)

### 3. Technical Achievement Summary
- Factual overview of system complexity
- List actual technical implementations achieved
- System capabilities (not business impact claims)

## Feature Documentation Format

### Individual Features
```
- **Feature Name** ✅ **⭐⭐⭐**
  *As a [user type], I can [capability] and [specific functionality].*
```

### Star Rating Criteria
- ⭐ Simple CRUD operations, basic forms
- ⭐⭐ Standard business logic with validation
- ⭐⭐⭐ Complex workflows with multiple integrations
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Advanced system integration with external APIs
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Complex multi-system coordination with real-time features

### Challenge/Solution/Impact Format
**EXACTLY** three lines per section:
```
**Challenge:** [One honest line describing core technical difficulty]
**Solution:** [One factual line explaining technical approach taken]
**Impact:** [One truthful line about what this actually achieves]
```

## Writing Guidelines

### DO Include:
- Specific technical implementations (e.g., "Convex optimistic concurrency control")
- Actual system capabilities (e.g., "Prevents booking conflicts")
- Real technical challenges faced (e.g., "High-concurrency booking conflicts")
- Factual complexity descriptions (e.g., "Multi-role permission system")

### NEVER Include:
- Percentage claims without data ("90% reduction", "80% faster")
- Time savings promises ("saves 2+ hours", "eliminates 20 hours")
- Marketing language ("game-changing", "revolutionary", "seamless")
- Unverifiable business impact ("improves user satisfaction")
- Future promises ("will enable", "ensures scalability")

### Tone and Language:
- **Technical but accessible** - explain complex concepts clearly
- **Factual and precise** - use specific technical terms
- **Respectful of intelligence** - don't oversimplify or oversell
- **Concise** - every word should add value

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing documentation, verify:
- [ ] No unsubstantiated metrics or percentages
- [ ] All technical claims are factually accurate
- [ ] Challenge/Solution/Impact blocks are exactly one line each
- [ ] Star ratings reflect actual implementation complexity
- [ ] User stories describe real capabilities, not promises
- [ ] Technical summary focuses on implementations, not business impact
- [ ] Language respects stakeholder intelligence
- [ ] No marketing fluff or sales language

## Example Section Structure

```markdown
## Authentication & User Management

### Core Authentication System
- **Role-based authentication** ✅ **⭐⭐⭐⭐**
  *As a user, I can log in and be automatically redirected based on my role.*

### Profile Management  
- **User profile management** ✅ **⭐⭐⭐**
  *As a staff member, I can edit my profile information and upload photos.*

**Challenge:** Managing complex multi-role authentication with role-specific navigation
**Solution:** Clerk authentication with custom role middleware and normalized role storage
**Impact:** Supports users with multiple roles while maintaining secure access control
```

## Remember

Your documentation will be reviewed by technical stakeholders who will validate claims and question inconsistencies. Prioritize **accuracy and honesty** over impressive-sounding promises. A truthful, modest description of actual capabilities is infinitely more valuable than inflated claims that cannot be substantiated.

**The goal is trust through transparency, not sales through exaggeration.**
