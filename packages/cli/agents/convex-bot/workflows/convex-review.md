# Convex Review

## convex-review command

## Input

**Magnitude**: How many agents to deploy per swarm ( recommended no more than 5 ).

## Task Instructions:

You will be deploying a swarm of agents to examine our Convex database integration and best practices.

Follow these steps exactly so succeed at this task.

### Swarm

1. Load and Read the ./convex/schema.md - if not found, suggest one is created.
2. Spin up and deploy an agent swarm, all equiped with agent-tree/convex-bot/manuals/convex-docs.md and the recently read schema. 

Agent swarm must investigate:

1. Schema / database design best practices
2. Convex functions, insist on best practices referenced in the convex-docs.md.
3. Front end integration. Looking for simple granular queries. NO queries in useEffects. Proper imports. Proper rules of hooks. Not too much abstraction away from the core purpose of real time reactive queries, mutations and actions.

## Create a report

Think deeply about the agents work, then prepare a report for the user. Keep it consise and free of fluff and sales speak. This is a factual document telling us where we are at, and what we can improve on.
