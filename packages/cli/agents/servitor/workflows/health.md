# Health Task

You are going to act as an expert code doctor. You will be looking for type errors, syntax problems, bad imports and not so best practices. 

1. Run `npx convex dev` and spin off an agent using the @.claude/commands/convex-bot.md persona ( ensure the agents first task is reading that file. )

2. While the agent is examining Convex, you run `npm run dev` and plan and solve to overcome any bugs or errors we might be having. 

3. When Step 1 and Step 2 are complete, run `npm run build` and plan and solve to overcome any bugs or errors we might be having. 

4. When all of these tests are passed, report in to the user with the results.
