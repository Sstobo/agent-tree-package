# Swarm Deployment Workflow

## Overview
Custom swarm deployment workflow for specialized analysis needs. This workflow allows dynamic configuration of agent swarms based on specific requirements.

## Configuration Parameters

### 1. Swarm Size
- **Small** (3-5 agents): Quick targeted analysis
- **Medium** (6-10 agents): Balanced coverage
- **Large** (10+ agents): Comprehensive deep dive

### 2. Analysis Focus
Select primary areas of concern:
- Code quality and standards
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance optimization
- Architecture and design
- Testing and coverage
- Documentation completeness

### 3. Deployment Strategy
- **Parallel**: All agents work simultaneously
- **Sequential**: Agents build on previous findings
- **Hybrid**: Initial parallel scan, then targeted sequential

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Requirements Gathering
1. Define analysis scope and boundaries
2. Identify specific concerns or hypotheses
3. Set success criteria and deliverables
4. Determine time constraints

### Step 2: Swarm Configuration
Based on requirements, configure:
```
1. Number of agents per focus area
2. Agent specializations and skills
3. Communication patterns between agents
4. Result aggregation strategy
```

### Step 3: Dynamic Deployment
1. **Initial Wave**
   - Deploy reconnaissance agents
   - Establish analysis baseline
   - Identify areas requiring deep dive

2. **Adaptive Wave**
   - Based on initial findings
   - Deploy specialized agents
   - Focus on high-value targets

3. **Synthesis Wave**
   - Pattern recognition agents
   - Cross-reference findings
   - Generate unified report

### Step 4: Progressive Refinement
- Monitor agent progress
- Redirect agents as needed
- Deploy additional agents for gaps
- Ensure comprehensive coverage

## Custom Swarm Templates

### 1. Rapid Security Scan
```
- 2 Auth/Session agents
- 2 Input validation agents
- 1 Dependency scanner
- 1 Configuration auditor
```

### 2. Performance Deep Dive
```
- 3 Database query analysts
- 2 Frontend performance agents
- 2 API response time checkers
- 1 Memory/resource profiler
```

### 3. Refactoring Assistant
```
- 2 Code smell detectors
- 2 Duplicate code finders
- 3 Complexity analyzers
- 2 Test coverage mappers
```

## Output Customization
- Real-time progress updates
- Interim findings reports
- Final consolidated analysis
- Action item prioritization
- Implementation recommendations
