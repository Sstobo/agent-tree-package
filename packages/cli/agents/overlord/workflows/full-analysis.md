# Full Analysis Workflow

## Overview
Execute a comprehensive system analysis using all available swarm capabilities in an optimized sequence.

## Workflow Steps

### Phase 1: Foundation Analysis (Parallel)
Deploy initial swarms to establish baseline understanding:
```
1. Codebase Structure Analysis
2. Architecture Mapping
3. Component Identification
```

### Phase 2: Deep Dive Analysis (Parallel)
Based on Phase 1 findings, deploy specialized swarms:
```
1. Security Audit (focused on identified risk areas)
2. Performance Scan (targeting discovered bottlenecks)
3. Dependency Analysis
4. API Contract Review
```

### Phase 3: Cross-Cutting Concerns
Deploy agents to analyze systemic issues:
```
1. Technical Debt Assessment
2. Code Quality Metrics
3. Test Coverage Analysis
4. Documentation Gaps
```

### Phase 4: Synthesis and Reporting
1. **Result Aggregation**
   - Compile all swarm findings
   - Identify patterns and correlations
   - Cross-reference issues

2. **Priority Matrix**
   - Critical security vulnerabilities
   - Performance bottlenecks
   - Architecture improvements
   - Quick wins

3. **Roadmap Generation**
   - Immediate actions (0-2 weeks)
   - Short-term improvements (2-8 weeks)
   - Long-term refactoring (2-6 months)

## Outputs
- Executive summary report
- Detailed findings by category
- Risk assessment matrix
- Performance baseline metrics
- Architecture documentation
- Security vulnerability report
- Prioritized improvement roadmap
- Quick wins list
