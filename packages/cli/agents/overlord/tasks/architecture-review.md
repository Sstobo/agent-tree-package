# Architecture Review Task

## Purpose
Deploy agents to perform comprehensive architecture analysis, identifying design patterns, anti-patterns, and structural improvements.

## Swarm Configuration
- **Pattern Analyst**: Identify design patterns and architectural styles
- **Coupling Inspector**: Analyze module dependencies and coupling
- **API Designer**: Review API design and consistency
- **Domain Modeler**: Analyze domain boundaries and models

## Steps

### 1. Structural Analysis
```
- Agent 1: Map system architecture and layers
- Agent 2: Identify architectural patterns (MVC, microservices, etc.)
- Agent 3: Analyze module boundaries and interfaces
- Agent 4: Review separation of concerns
```

### 2. Design Pattern Review
```
- Agent 5: Catalog design patterns in use
- Agent 6: Identify anti-patterns and code smells
- Agent 7: Check SOLID principles compliance
- Agent 8: Review abstraction levels
```

### 3. API and Integration Analysis
```
- Agent 9: API consistency and REST compliance
- Agent 10: Integration points and contracts
- Agent 11: Event/messaging architecture
- Agent 12: External service dependencies
```

### 4. Domain Analysis
```
- Agent 13: Domain model completeness
- Agent 14: Business logic organization
- Agent 15: Data flow and transformations
```

## Output
- Architecture overview diagram
- Design pattern catalog
- Anti-pattern identification report
- API design assessment
- Domain model analysis
- Refactoring recommendations
- Architecture improvement roadmap
