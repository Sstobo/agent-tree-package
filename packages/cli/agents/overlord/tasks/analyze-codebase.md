# Analyze Codebase Task

## Purpose
Deploy a swarm of agents to comprehensively analyze the codebase structure, dependencies, and organization.

## Swarm Configuration
- **Structure Scanner**: Map directory hierarchy and file organization
- **Dependency Analyzer**: Trace import chains and module dependencies
- **Pattern Detector**: Identify coding patterns and conventions
- **Component Mapper**: Document major components and their relationships

## Steps

### 1. Deploy Parallel Agents
```
- Agent 1: Scan project structure and create file tree
- Agent 2: Analyze package dependencies and imports
- Agent 3: Identify architectural patterns and conventions
- Agent 4: Map component relationships and data flow
```

### 2. Targeted Deep Dives
Based on initial findings, deploy specialized agents to:
- Investigate complex subsystems
- Analyze critical path dependencies
- Document API boundaries
- Map data models and schemas

### 3. Synthesis
- Aggregate all agent findings
- Create dependency graphs
- Generate architecture diagrams
- Identify technical debt areas

## Output
- Complete codebase map
- Dependency analysis report
- Architecture documentation
- Component relationship diagram
- Technical debt inventory
- Recommended improvements
